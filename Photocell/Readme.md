# Photoresistor

1) The arduino sketch samples the voltage across the photoresistor and performans an analog to digital conversion. These digital values are send over the serial port to the pc. This data can be collected using the PhotoCell program in the vrClient program. Sampling rate is approximately 3500 Hz. Additionaly, the arduino sketch allows th
